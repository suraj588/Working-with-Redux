## Create Redux folder
## Create the following files - actionType.js, action.js, reducer.js, store.js
## First decide the actions to be performed by your Application.



## Action.js should contain functions accepting payload as a parameter. This payload will be a value which you need to use in updating the state later on. The functions should return an object with type and payload as keys.
